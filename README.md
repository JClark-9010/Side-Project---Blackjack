# Repo1

Project created in Visual Studio. Used Tech Elevator course material for reference (past lessons, pair projects). 
Googled a fair amount for various things (easy ways to shuffle a list).
Spent about 6 to 8 hours on project to get program running. 
Refactored most of Gameplay class. 
Most issues arose from the various ways a hand can end (dealer stands but player takes multiple additional cards, vice versa).

Todo: Add try-catch to Console.Reads. Add wagering. Add a computer player. Add rules.
